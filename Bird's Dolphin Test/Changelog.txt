Netplay session replays that are saved to the WII (NOT SD CARD) will be saved in the folder named "ReplayData" 
	To view these replays use Bird's Replay Manager.exe or copy the one from the session you want and go here: 
	/User/Wii/title/00010000/52534245/data and replace collect.vff with the one you want to view (rename it to collect.vff) then launch the game offline (not in a netplay window)
